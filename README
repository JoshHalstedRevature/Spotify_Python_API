## Features



## Usage

If the user is working on this package of files on a local machine (e.g. Python is installed on local Windows or Linux machine), then the user needs to transfer the file from local to maria_dev with the following command:

scp -P 2222 C:\Path\to\myTest.txt maria_dev@sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com:/home/maria_dev

Then, using a network file transfer application like PuTTY, transfer the myTest.txt file from /home/maria_dev to /user/maria_dev via the following command:

The user then needs to transfer the executable from local to /home/maria_dev:

scp -P 2222 C:\Path\to\example.py maria_dev@sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com:/home/maria_dev

Once three things are completed, the user then needs to do the following:
* Thing 1
* Thing 2
* Thing 3
* Thing 4
* Thing 5
